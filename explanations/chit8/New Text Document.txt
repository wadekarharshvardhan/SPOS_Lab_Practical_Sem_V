Certainly! Here's an explanation of the **Round Robin Scheduling** simulation program in Java:

---

### **Overview:**
This program simulates the **Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm**, where each process gets a fixed time slot called a quantum to execute. If a process isn't finished within its quantum, it is preempted and added back to the end of the queue to wait for its next turn.

---

### **Key Components:**

#### 1. **Process Class:**
```java
class Process {
    int id, burst, remaining;
    Process(int id, int burst) {
        this.id = id;
        this.burst = burst;
        this.remaining = burst;
    }
}
```
- Represents each process with:
  - `id`: Process ID
  - `burst`: Total burst time
  - `remaining`: Remaining execution time (initially equal to burst time)

---

### **Main Logic:**

#### 2. **Initialization:**
```java
int[] bursts = {5, 3, 8, 6}; // burst times of processes
int quantum = 3; // time slice for each process
Queue<Process> queue = new LinkedList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < bursts.length; i++) queue.add(new Process(i + 1, bursts[i]));
```
- Defines burst times for four processes.
- Sets the quantum (time slice) to 3 units.
- Adds processes to a queue in order.

#### 3. **Simulation Loop:**
```java
int time = 0;
while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
    Process p = queue.poll();
    if (p.remaining > quantum) {
        System.out.println("Process " + p.id + " executed from " + time + " to " + (time + quantum));
        p.remaining -= quantum;
        time += quantum;
        queue.add(p);
    } else {
        System.out.println("Process " + p.id + " executed from " + time + " to " + (time + p.remaining));
        time += p.remaining;
        p.remaining = 0; // optional, process finished
    }
}
```
- **Fetches** the process at the front of the queue.
- If the process's remaining time exceeds the quantum:
  - Executes it for `quantum` units.
  - Decreases its remaining time.
  - Adds it back to the queue for further execution.
- If the process can finish within the quantum:
  - Executes it completely.
  - Updates the current time.
  - The process is considered complete and not re-added.

---

### **Summary:**
- Implements **Round Robin Scheduling**.
- Processes are executed in a cyclic order with fixed time slices.
- The program outputs the start and end times for each process's execution slice.

Would you like me to extend this to compute waiting times, turnaround times, or show the Gantt chart?
