Certainly! Here's an explanation of the **FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Page Replacement Algorithm** simulation program in Java:

---

### **Overview:**
This program simulates the FIFO page replacement algorithm, which replaces the oldest page in memory when a new page needs to be loaded and the frames are full.

---

### **Key Components:**

#### 1. **Reference String and Frame Count:**
```java
int[] pages = {1, 3, 0, 3, 5, 6}; // reference string
int frames = 3; // number of frames
```
- The reference string indicates pages accessed sequentially.
- The number of frames indicates how many pages can be held in memory simultaneously.

---

#### 2. **Data Structures:**
```java
Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>(); // to keep track of page order
Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); // for quick lookup
int faults = 0; // count page faults
```
- **queue:** Maintains the order of pages for FIFO replacement.
- **set:** Ensures quick containment checks.
- **faults:** Counts the total number of page faults during the simulation.

### **Main Logic:**

```java
for (int page : pages) {
    if (!set.contains(page)) {
        if (queue.size() == frames) {
            int removed = queue.poll(); // remove oldest page
            set.remove(removed);
        }
        queue.add(page);
        set.add(page);
        faults++;
    }
    System.out.println("Frames: " + queue);
}
System.out.println("Total page faults: " + faults);
```

- For each page in the reference string:
  - **Check** if the page is already in memory (`set.contains(page)`).
  - **If not:**
    - If memory is full (`queue.size() == frames`), remove the oldest page (`queue.poll()`) and update the set.
    - Load the new page into memory (`queue.add(page)`) and update the set.
    - Increment page fault count.
- After each page access, the current state of the frames is printed.
- At the end, total page faults are displayed.

---

### **Summary:**
- Implements FIFO page replacement.
- Tracks how pages are loaded and replaced.
- Counts total page faults during the process.

Would you like me to extend this with other page replacement algorithms like LRU or Optimal?
