Sure! Here's a detailed yet simple explanation of what the code does and how it works:

### What the code does:
This Java program performs the **first pass** of a two-pass assembler for a pseudo-machine. Its main purpose is to:

1. Read assembly language instructions from an input file.
2. Identify labels (symbols) and record their addresses in a symbol table.
3. Generate an intermediate file with addresses and instructions for the next pass.

### How it works (step-by-step):

1. **Initialization:**
   - Opens "input.txt" for reading instructions.
   - Creates two output files: "symtab.txt" (symbol table) and "intermediate.txt" (intermediate code).

2. **Processing each line:**
   - Reads each line from the input file.
   - Splits the line into tokens (words).
   - Checks if the line starts with "START":
     - If yes, sets the `locctr` (location counter) to the specified starting address.
   - Otherwise, if the line has a label (non-empty first token):
     - Stores the label and current `locctr` in the symbol table (`symbolTable`).
   - Writes the current address (`locctr`) and the instruction line to the intermediate file.
   - Increments `locctr` by 1 to move to the next instruction address.

3. **After processing all lines:**
   - Writes the symbol table (labels and their addresses) into "symtab.txt".
   - Closes all files and outputs a message indicating the first pass is complete.

### Summary:
- Finds labels in assembly code and records where they are located.
- Prepares an intermediate file with addresses for the second pass.
- Builds a symbol table for resolving labels later.

Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the Java code for your viva:

This Java program simulates the first pass of a two-pass assembler for a pseudo-machine.

- **Main Function:**  
  It reads assembly instructions from "input.txt" and generates a symbol table ("symtab.txt") and an intermediate file ("intermediate.txt").

- **Variables:**  
  - `symbolTable`: A HashMap to store labels (symbols) and their addresses (location counter).  
  - `locctr`: An integer representing the location counter, which tracks the address of instructions.

- **Process:**
  - Reads each line from the input file.  
  - If the line contains "START", it initializes `locctr` with the specified starting address.  
  - If the line has a label (non-empty first token), it adds the label and current `locctr` to `symbolTable`.  
  - Writes the current `locctr` and line to the intermediate file for further processing.  
  - Increments `locctr` by 1 for the next instruction.

- **Output:**  
  - After processing all lines, it writes the symbol table (labels and their addresses) to "symtab.txt".  
  - Closes all files and indicates completion.

**Overall Purpose:**  
To build a symbol table and an intermediate file that will be used in the second pass to generate machine code.
