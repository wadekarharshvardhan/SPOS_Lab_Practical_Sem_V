Certainly! Here's an explanation of the **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)** CPU Scheduling simulation program in Java:

---

### **Overview:**
This program simulates the FCFS scheduling algorithm, where processes are handled in the order they arrive. It calculates each process's start and finish times based on arrival and burst times.

---

### **Key Components:**

#### 1. **Process Class:**
```java
class Process {
    int pid, arrivalTime, burstTime, startTime, finishTime;

    Process(int pid, int arrivalTime, int burstTime) {
        this.pid = pid;
        this.arrivalTime = arrivalTime;
        this.burstTime = burstTime;
    }
}
```
- Represents a process with:
  - `pid`: Process ID
  - `arrivalTime`: When the process arrives
  - `burstTime`: Duration needed for execution
  - `startTime`: When the process starts execution (to be calculated)
  - `finishTime`: When the process completes execution (to be calculated)

### **Main Logic of the FCFS Class:**

#### 2. **Creating Processes:**
```java
List<Process> processes = new ArrayList<>();
processes.add(new Process(1, 0, 6));
processes.add(new Process(2, 2, 4));
processes.add(new Process(3, 4, 2));
processes.add(new Process(4, 6, 5));
```
- Adds sample processes with specific arrival and burst times.

#### 3. **Sorting by Arrival Time:**
```java
processes.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.arrivalTime));
```
- Ensures processes are ordered based on arrival times for FCFS.

#### 4. **Simulation Variables:**
```java
int clock = 0; // Tracks current time
Queue<Process> queue = new LinkedList<>(); // Processes ready for execution
List<Process> completed = new ArrayList<>(); // To store completed processes
```

#### 5. **Simulation Loop:**
```java
while (!processes.isEmpty() || !queue.isEmpty()) {
    while (!processes.isEmpty() && processes.get(0).arrivalTime <= clock) {
        queue.add(processes.remove(0));
    }
    if (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Process current = queue.poll();
        current.startTime = clock; // Process starts now
        clock += current.burstTime; // Move clock forward
        current.finishTime = clock; // Process completes now
        completed.add(current);
    } else {
        clock++; // Idle CPU if no process is ready
    }
}
```
- **Loads** all processes that have arrived by the current clock time into the queue.
- **Processes** the first process in the queue:
  - Sets its start time.
  - Advances the clock by its burst time.
  - Records its finish time.
  - Adds it to completed list.
- If no process is available, the clock increments (CPU idle time).

#### 6. **Output:**
```java
for (Process p : completed) {
    System.out.println("Process " + p.pid + ": Start = " + p.startTime + ", Finish = " + p.finishTime);
}
```
- Prints start and finish times for each process.

---

### **Summary:**
- The program sorts processes by arrival time.
- Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
- Calculates and displays each process's start and finish times based on the FCFS algorithm.
